# Examples using Java

The TestEnvironment class checks if the daemon is running, and if not will start it before running the test.

Alternatively it is possible to go to the main folder in a separate terminal and type:

```bash
cd ..
make startdaemon
```

Samples show logs on terminal.

The gradle file builds generated java classes from the proto file.
